<h3> Reflection July 19Th </h3>
<p> Python and Scratch are both programs used when codeing, they both are used to give the computer orders to do what you want it do, in both you can create loops. They are different because in python you can create functions, in both you can ask questions to create and order. </p>
<p> Today was really hard, because I had to find what was wrong and sometimes it was little mistakes. But after it felt so good to do it </p>
